# Des Moines Citi Bike Analysis
Although Des Moines, IA has a significantly smaller population, there is quite a few supporting data from the New York City Analysis that support Des Moines as a desireable place for Citi Bike Investment.
## Profit
The biggest drivers for revenue is the frequency of bike usage as well as the duration of the bike usage. There are four metrics that are the biggest drivers for profit: Population, Age, Attractions and Gender
### Does the population affect the number of people who will use the bike-sharing program?
Off the bat Des Moines is a significantly lower in  sheer population total. Despite this difference we believe this area can provide a higher margin percentage/return. Even within the past
Des Moines grew from 204,183 to 216,853 with a 6.2% increase
NYC grew from 8,174,988 to 8,398,748 2.7% increase. Des Moines rate of increase has been over twice as much as New York city and has been projected to continue to soar Making this desireable for long term investment (https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/fact/table/newyorkcitynewyork,desmoinescityiowa/PST045219)

 Although NYC can increase revenue, supporting data will show that this will actually provide a lower return on refund.
### Age (Page 1 of story)
The single birth year with the highest number of records and trip duration is 1969. The highest range of of birth year is also after 1969.
Per the United States Census, Des Moines has a higher percentage age group that is 65 and under, which falls into to target age range.
### Location of Attractions. (Page 2 of story)
The target heat maps of high bike usage refelct Manhattan's attraction spot.
Per Google Maps (https://www.google.com/maps), Des Moines is larger than Manhattan with more pockets of Attraction bundles. All with a higher attraction to Population ratio. (https://www.catchdesmoines.com/things-to-do/)
### Gender (page 3 of story)
Data indicates that most of users and Long term customers are dominated by male. Des Moines has a higher percentage of males, making Des Moines a more ideal location from a gender perspective.
## Conclusion

Although the sheer volume of population does not affect profit, it is the targeting the key metrics that have been highlighted in the New York City analysis; the 1969-and-younger-age-group, attractions and males, which are all highly more favorable in Des Moines.

Although New York City may yield more revenue, data shows that Des Moines will yield a higher return on investments.
